# US airports network analysis
This notebook contains a study on the US airports network and its flight connections, during the year 2009. The aim of this project is to represent a wide, complex real-world network as a directed graph. This representation enables the calculation of some performance metrics, expressing the importance and centrality of both nodes and edges, under different assumptions. As a result, airports and routes can be ranked, according to different criteria.

## Research questions
Given the raw dataset, this study answers the following questions:
- which are the most important airports, in terms of population living in the corresponding metropolitan area?
- which airports are more important, in terms of number of connections provided?
- which are the most crowded routes?
- which are on average the most efficient routes?

### Dataset availability
Due to file size limitations, the airports dataset is available in the pre-release.
